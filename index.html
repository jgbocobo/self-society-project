                    <p><strong>Personal Reflection:</strong><br>
                    This feedback was somewhat expected, but I was surprised by how much they look up to me. Realizing that I impact their habits and perspectives is humbling. It motivates me to be more intentional about the influence I have on the people I care about.

                            <div class="value-body">
                                <p>This is number one for me, no question. You know why? Because I've seen what happens when people aren't loyal. I've had friends who were there when everything was fun and easy, but disappeared the moment things got tough. And I've had friends who stuck around through my worst days—when I was dealing with that brutal breakup, when I wasn't the most pleasant person to be around.</p>
                                <p>Loyalty to me means showing up. It means if you say you're my friend, you actually mean it. When my friends Eloisa, Catrina, and Christian said I check on them when they're down, that's loyalty in action. I do it because that's what real friendship looks like. Not just hanging out when it's convenient, but actually caring about what happens to the people in your circle.</p>
                                <p>I'm the type who won't offer friendship easily, but once I consider you a friend, I'm all in. I'll maintain that relationship, I'll show up, I'll remember the small things. And I expect the same back. If you're loyal to me, I'll be loyal to you—it's that simple. But break that trust? That's something I won't forget.</p>

                                <p>I can't stand fake people. Like, I really can't. In a world where everyone's trying to show their best version on social media, where people say one thing and do another, being honest is almost rare. But it's so important to me.</p>
                                <p>I'd rather you tell me the hard truth than a comfortable lie. When my friends called me "boastful," I actually appreciated that they were honest about it. They added that I have the capabilities to back it up, which was nice, but the fact that they felt comfortable enough to say something that might hurt my feelings? That's real honesty.</p>
                                <p>I try to live this way too. If I think something, I'll say it—not in a mean way, but in a real way. People might find me intimidating at first because of this. I don't sugarcoat things. But those who get past that initial impression realize I'm just being genuine. I'd rather be real and risk someone not liking me than pretend to be someone I'm not.</p>

                                <p>I'll be honest—empathy doesn't come naturally to me. I'm working on it. I used to be the type who'd think "just get over it" when people complained about their problems. But life has a way of teaching you lessons, doesn't it?</p>
                                <p>When I went through my own struggles—that breakup that knocked me down, the times I felt like I wasn't good enough—I realized how hard life actually is. How much we all need someone to understand without judging. Now I get it. Now when my friends are going through something, I try to actually feel what they're feeling, not just hear what they're saying.</p>
                                <p>I read psychology books now, trying to understand how people think and why they act certain ways. Not to manipulate anyone, but to connect better. To be the kind of friend who actually gets it. I'm still learning, still growing in this area. But that's the point—I'm trying. And I need people around me who understand that growth isn't instant, who can be patient with me as I figure this out.</p>

                            <div class="value-body">
                                <p>This is different from empathy—at least to me. Empathy is understanding what someone feels. Compassion is doing something about it. And man, do I respect people who show real compassion.</p>
                                <p>My parents are like this. They've overcome so many problems in their lives, and instead of becoming bitter, they became kinder. That resilience I inherited from them? It came with a side of compassion. They taught me that being strong doesn't mean being hard.</p>
                                <p>When my friends described me as someone who checks on them, as someone "sibling-like" who cares—that meant everything to me. Because that's the kind of person I want to be. Not just someone who understands your pain, but someone who actually helps carry it. Whether it's inviting you to play billiards to take your mind off things, or just sitting with you when you need company.</p>
                                <p>I want to influence people to be more compassionate too. The world's rough enough as it is. We need more people who give a damn about each other.</p>

                                <p>I'm obsessed with growth, but not in that toxic productivity way. I'm not trying to be perfect or hustle 24/7. I'm talking about real growth—the kind that actually changes you as a person.</p>
                                <p>You know what's funny? I used to think I knew everything. I used to dismiss sexuality as "there's only boys and girls, what's the big deal?" Now I understand that I was ignorant. That learning changed me. That's growth—being willing to admit you were wrong and actually changing your perspective.</p>
                                <p>I actively do things that scare me. Not stupid things, but things outside my comfort zone. Why? Because that's where growth happens. That breakup that devastated me? It forced me to grow. It made me realize there were so many things I needed to improve about myself. And I did the work.</p>
                                <p>Growth to me means becoming a better version of myself without losing who I am at the core. It means being open to new experiences while staying true to my values. It's a slow process—I'm taking steady steps, not rushing. But I'm committed to it for life.</p>

                    What stands out most is that I am still in the process of becoming. I don't have all the answers, and I am comfortable with that uncertainty. Through the eyes of others, I've seen that my impact extends beyond what I realize. My manifestos serve as guideposts—living documents that will evolve as I do.
